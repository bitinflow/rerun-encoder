## Introduction

The Rerun Encoder is a tool that allows streamers to transcode videos on their own PCs, eliminating the need to process
videos on the rerunmanager.com servers. This is extremely useful for streamers who have a lot of videos to process, or
streamers who want to process videos as soon as they are done streaming.

## Features

- Transcode videos on your own PC
- Upload videos directly to rerunmanager.com
- Videos up to 12 hours long

## Installation

### Windows

> If Windows Defender SmartScreen blocks the installation, just click "Run anyway". This is because of a missing code
> signing certificate, which we still need to obtain.

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/bitinflow/rerun-encoder/releases/latest).
2. Once downloaded, execute the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, you need to log in with your rerunmanager.com account. You can do this by
   clicking the "Login with Rerun Manager" button in the bottom right corner of the application.
